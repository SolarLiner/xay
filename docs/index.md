# Welcome to xây

xây is an easy to use build system that relies on convention over configuration to generate build files.
It works with a plugin system that makes xây easily extensible.

## Non-goals

xây does not pretend to be a one-size-fits-all solution. Large projects will have convoluted build systems
and may not be able to fit within the conventions described below. However the author of this project believes
that many projects not only can fit the conventions, but will benefit from it also.  
What makes xây powerful and easy to use is also its Achille's heel: it's relative lack of configurability from
its rigid conventions.
